## 📦 Installation

#### Debian/Ubuntu

Packaging assets live in `debian/` and target modern Python (3.10+). If you're building locally,
use your distro's standard `dpkg-buildpackage` workflow.

---

#### Arch

An AUR package is available, and `packaging/arch/PKGBUILD` provides a modern PKGBUILD baseline.

---

#### Snap

Snap packaging is provided in `snap/snapcraft.yaml` (strict confinement, session D-Bus).

---

#### From Source

UChroma requires Python 3.10 or newer and uses `uv` for dependency management.

System integration (udev + systemd user service):

    sudo make install-udev
    sudo make install-service
    systemctl --user daemon-reload
    systemctl --user enable --now uchromad.service

Be sure to uninstall any other software which might alter permissions or change behavior of the devices or kernel HID drivers.

## ⚡ Usage

UChroma consists of two main executables, _uchromad_ and _uchroma_. The _uchromad_ executable runs in the background as a systemd user service, handles all hardware interactions, executes animations, stores preferences, and publishes several D-Bus services for clients to use. The _uchroma_ command provides a uniform interface to all discovered devices. The CLI tool is based on subcommands (similar to Git), and help can be viewed at any level by passing the "-h" flag.

---

### Listing devices

```
$ uchroma -l
[1532:0210.00]: Blade Pro (Late 2016) (BladeProLate2016 / v0.38)
[1532:0510.01]: Kraken 7.1 V2 (Kylie) (HN1649D04607845 / v1.135)
```

The number after the dot is the device index. You may select a target device with the -d flag using the full identifier or just the device index.

### Animations

UChroma supports custom animations on devices which support a lighting matrix, such as Blade laptops, BlackWidow keyboards, and Mamba mice. Several animation renderers are included, and may also be provided by third-party modules. Multiple concurrent (stacked) animations are supported, and layers will be alpha-blended together. Animations may run at different frame rates, and may trigger from input events or sound. Current animation parameters are shown in the "uchroma dump" command, shown above.

$ uchroma -d 0 anim list

## 🔮 Frequently Asked Questions

#### _My device is not recognized!_

> If you have a device which is not yet supported, you have a couple of options. If the device does not require a new protocol, it can simply be added to the appropriate YAML file under uchroma/server/data. If you like to see a particular model added, please open an issue on Github. If you've added support for a new device, please open a pull request!

#### _This is great, how can I donate hardware or fund development?_

> Razer makes a lot of devices, each with it's own quirks. If you'd like to see a piece of hardware supported, the best way to motivate me is to ship me a device to work with. If you'd like to help ensure continued development, please consider [sending a donation](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=2UQ62RBEANCHQ).

#### _How do I make a custom animation?_

> Proper documentation on this topic is forthcoming, but having a look at the bundled renderers in uchroma/fxlib should be enough to get started on. Implementations must extend **Renderer** and implement the _init_, _finish_, and _draw_ methods. The animation system is a framebuffer and the draw method will be invoked at the FPS requested by your implementation. It's important to keep the FPS as low as possible to avoid unnecessary CPU usage! The draw method is called with a **Layer** object, which provides primitives for drawing shapes and setting individual pixels. The buffer of a frame is a Numpy matrix and may be manipulated directly, if desired. Functions for performing color math and generating gradients/color schemes can be found in the _uchroma.color_ module. We use **Traitlets** for user-configurable parameters.
>
> To get an out-of-tree module recognized, declare an entry point to your effect in your module's setup.py:

    entry_points={
        'uchroma.plugins': ['renderer = my.effect.module:MyClass']
    }

Send a pull request if you implement a new renderer and would like to have it included!

#### _Are you affiliated with Razer Inc?_

> Not in any way, but I won't mind if they deliver a truckload of hardware to me :)

#### _Is Windows supported?_

> No. UChroma relies on UDev and other Linux-specific subsystems to operate.

#### _Is macro recording supported?_

> The skeleton of macro support is there, and will be finished in an upcoming release.

#### _The ripple effect seems misaligned with my keypresses!_

> This is because a mapping of keycodes to LED matrix coordinates must be provided, and the layout varies wildly among devices. Full support in the initial release is provided for the Blade Pro laptop, and a "generic" mapping is provided for other models which is almost certainly wrong. If you'd like to create a proper mapping for your device (and contribute it back!), I've created a simple tool which will help. You'll need to start _uchromad_ with UCHROMA_DEV=1 set in the environment, then run "scripts/devstuff keys" from the source distribution. The tool will illuminate matrix cells and you just press the key that is lit, repeating for all cells. After creating a new mapping, it will need merged into the appropriate YAML file under uchroma/server/data (and send a pull request!). Support for cell swapping and relocation is also provided, see the Blade Pro configuration for an example of this.

#### _There are other projects with similar functionality, why this?_

> This project was born after realizing that there is zero chance to have the required code used by other projects merged into the Linux kernel since it's very specialized and can be done entirely in userspace. I also wanted rich animation support and low power consumption, which required rewriting large portions of the existing project (and my patches weren't moving forward). After implementing the initial user-space driver, I decided to keep going and try to make the hardware really shine under Linux. Choose what works best for you!

#### _Is a GUI available?_

> Yes! A GTK4 frontend with libadwaita styling is included. Run `uchroma-gtk` to launch it. The GUI provides a live LED matrix preview, effect configuration, and layer management.

#### _How can I contribute?_

> Fork the project and send a pull request with a description of your changes. As this project is currently at the initial release stage, a lot of testing across different models is needed. Documentation is lacking, and support for more distributions is also high on the list. If you find a bug, please file an issue on Github.
